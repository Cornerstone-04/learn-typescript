# TypeScript Lessons

- TypeScript is JavaScript with syntax for types.
- It is a strongly typed language that builds on JavaScript providing better tooling.
- `tsc --init` is used to initialise a config file for TS settings.
- `tsc -w` is used to compile and watch for changes.

## Terminologies

- Strongly-typed: this demands the specification of data types.
- Inference: TS infers (specifies/suggests) what type of data is defined.
- Statically-typed: data typing is checked at compile time.

## Benefits

- Catch errors during development.
- Self documenting.
